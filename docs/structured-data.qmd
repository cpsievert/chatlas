# Structured data

When using an LLM to extract data from text or images, you can ask the chatbot to nicely format it, in JSON or any other format that you like. This will generally work well most of the time, but there's no gaurantee that you'll actually get the exact format that you want. In particular, if you're trying to get JSON, find that it's typically surrounded in ```` ```json ````, and you'll occassionally get text that isn't actually valid JSON. To avoid these challenges you can use a recent LLM feature: **structured data** (aka structured output). With structured data, you supply a type specification that exactly defines the object structure that you want and the LLM will guarantee that's what you get back.

```{python}
from chatlas import ChatOpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel
```

## Structured data basics

To extract structured data you call the `.extract_data()` method instead of the `.chat()` method. You'll also need to define a type specification that describes the structure of the data that you want (more on that shortly). Here's a simple example that extracts two specific values from a string:

```{python}
class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int


chat = ChatOpenAI()
chat.extract_data(
  "My name is Susan and I'm 13 years old", 
  data_model=Person,
)
```

The same basic idea works with images too:

```{python}
from chatlas import content_image_url

class Image(BaseModel):
    primary_shape: str
    primary_colour: str

chat.extract_data(
  content_image_url("https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png"),
  data_model=Image,
)
```


## Data types basics

To define your desired type specification (also known as a **schema**), you use a [pydantic model](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/). 

In addition to the model definition with field names and types, you may also want to provide the LLM with an additional context about what each field represents. In this case, include a docstring below each field/model definition. This is a good place to ask nicely for other attributes you'll like the value to possess (e.g. minimum or maximum values, date formats, ...). You aren't guaranteed that these requests will be honoured, but the LLM will usually make a best effort to do so.

```{python}
class Person(BaseModel):
    """A person"""

    name: str
    """Name"""

    age: int
    """Age, in years."""

    hobbies: list[str]
    """List of hobbies. Should be exclusive and brief."""
```

Now we'll dive into some examples before coming back to talk more data types details.

## Examples

The following examples are [closely inspired by the Claude documentation](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/tool_use/extracting_structured_json.ipynb) and hint at some of the ways you can use structured data extraction.

### Example 1: Article summarisation

```{python}
with open("examples/third-party-testing.txt") as f:
    text = f.read()


class ArticleSummary(BaseModel):
    """Summary of the article."""

    author: str
    """Name of the article author"""

    topics: list[str]
    """Array of topics, e.g. ["tech", "politics"]. Should be as specific as possible, and can overlap."""

    summary: str
    """Summary of the article. One or two paragraphs max"""

    coherence: int
    """Coherence of the article's key points, 0-100 (inclusive)"""

    persuasion: float
    """Article's persuasion score, 0.0-1.0 (inclusive)"""


chat = ChatOpenAI()
data = chat.extract_data(text, data_model=ArticleSummary)
print(data)
```

### Example 2: Named entity recognition

```{python}
text = "John works at Google in New York. He met with Sarah, the CEO of Acme Inc., last week in San Francisco."

class NamedEntity(BaseModel):
    """Named entity in the text."""

    name: str
    """The extracted entity name."""

    type_: str
    """The entity type, e.g. "person", "location", "organization"."""

    context: str
    """The context in which the entity appears in the text."""


class NamedEntities(BaseModel):
    """Named entities in the text."""

    entities: list[NamedEntity]
    """Array of named entities"""


chat = ChatOpenAI()
chat.extract_data(text, data_model=NamedEntities)
```

### Example 3: Sentiment analysis

```{python}
text = "The product was okay, but the customer service was terrible. I probably won't buy from them again."

class Sentiment(BaseModel):
    """Extract the sentiment scores of a given text. Sentiment scores should sum to 1."""

    positive_score: float
    """Positive sentiment score, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0."""

    negative_score: float
    """Negative sentiment score, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0."""

    neutral_score: float
    """Neutral sentiment score, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0."""


chat = ChatOpenAI()
chat.extract_data(text, data_model=Sentiment)
```

Note that we've asked nicely for the scores to sum 1, and they do in this example (at least when I ran the code), but it's not guaranteed.

### Example 4: Text classification

```{python}
from typing import Literal

text = "The new quantum computing breakthrough could revolutionize the tech industry."

class Classification(BaseModel):
    """Array of classification results. The scores should sum to 1."""

    name: Literal["Politics", "Sports", "Technology", "Entertainment", "Business", "Other"]
    """The category name"""

    score: float
    """The classification score for the category, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0."""


chat = ChatOpenAI()
data = chat.extract_data(text, data_model=Classification)
# do.call(rbind, lapply(data$classification, as.data.frame))
# TODO: make into a data frame
print(data)
```

<!--
Here we created a wrapper object because the OpenAI API requires all structured data to use an object. If you're working with Claude or Gemini, the code is a little simpler:

```r
chat <- chat_claude()
data <- chat$extract_data(text, spec = classification)
do.call(rbind, lapply(data, as.data.frame))
```
-->

### Example 5: Working with unknown keys

```{python}
from chatlas import ChatAnthropic

class Characteristics(BaseModel, extra="allow"):
    """All characteristics"""
    pass

prompt = """
  Given a description of a character, your task is to extract all the characteristics of that character.

  <description>
  The man is tall, with a beard and a scar on his left cheek. He has a deep voice and wears a black leather jacket.
  </description>
"""

chat = ChatAnthropic()
chat.extract_data(prompt, data_model=Characteristics)
```

This examples only works with Claude, not GPT or Gemini, because only Claude
supports adding arbitrary additional properties.

### Example 6: Extracting data from an image

This example comes from [Dan Nguyen](https://gist.github.com/dannguyen/faaa56cebf30ad51108a9fe4f8db36d8) and you can see other interesting applications at that link.

The goal is to extract structured data from this screenshot:

![A screenshot of schedule A: a table showing assets and "unearned" income](congressional-assets.png)

Even without any descriptions, ChatGPT does pretty well:

```{python}
from chatlas import content_image_file


class Asset(BaseModel):
    assert_name: str
    owner: str
    location: str
    asset_value_low: int
    asset_value_high: int
    income_type: str
    income_low: int
    income_high: int
    tx_gt_1000: bool


class DisclosureReport(BaseModel):
    assets: list[Asset]


chat = ChatOpenAI()
data = chat.extract_data(
    content_image_file("images/congressional-assets.png"), data_model=DisclosureReport
)
data
```

## Advanced data types

Now that you've seen a few examples, it's time to get into more specifics about data type declarations.

### Required vs optional

By default, all components of an object are required. If you want to make some optional, set `required = FALSE`. This is a good idea if you don't think your text will always contain the required fields as LLMs may hallucinate data in order to fulfill your spec.

For example, here the LLM hallucinates a date even though there isn't one in the text:

```{python}
class ArticleSpec(BaseModel):
    """Information about an article written in markdown"""

    title: str
    """Article title"""
    author: str
    """Name of the author"""
    date: str
    """Date written in YYYY-MM-DD format."""


prompt = """
  Extract data from the following text:

  <text>
  # Structured Data
  By Hadley Wickham

  When using an LLM to extract data from text or images, you can ask the chatbot to nicely format it, in JSON or any other format that you like.
  </text>
"""

chat = ChatOpenAI()
data = chat.extract_data(prompt, data_model=ArticleSpec)
data
```

Note that I've used more of an explict prompt here. For this example, I found that this generated better results, and it's a useful place to put additional instructions.

If let the LLM know that the fields are all optional, it'll instead return `NULL` for the missing fields:

```{python}
class ArticleSpec(BaseModel):
    """Information about an article written in markdown"""

    title: str | None
    """Article title"""
    author: str | None
    """Name of the author"""
    date: str | None
    """Date written in YYYY-MM-DD format."""


chat.extract_data(prompt, data_model=ArticleSpec)
```

<!--
### Data frames

If you want to define a data frame like object, you might be tempted to create a definition similar to what R uses: an object (i.e. a named list) containing multiple vectors (i.e. arrays):

```r
my_df_type <- type_object(
  name = type_array(items = type_string()),
  age = type_array(items = type_integer()),
  height = type_array(items = type_number()),
  weight = type_array(items = type_number())
)
```

This however, is not quite right becuase there's no way to specify that each array should have the same length. Instead you need to turn the data structure "inside out", and instead create an array of objects:

```r
my_df_type <- type_array(
  items = type_object(
    name = type_string(),
    age = type_integer(),
    height = type_number(),
    weight = type_number()
  )
)
```

If you're familiar with the terms between row-oriented and column-oriented data frames, this is the same idea. Since most language don't possess vectorisation like R, row-oriented structures tend to be much more common in the wild.

If you're working with OpenAI, you'll need to wrap this in a dummy object because OpenAI requires an when doing structured data extraction. See Example 4 above for a concrete example.

#| type: asis
#| echo: false
token_usage()
