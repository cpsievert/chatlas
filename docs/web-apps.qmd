In the intro, we learned how the `.app()` method launches a web app with a simple chat interface, for example:

```python
from chatlas import ChatAnthropic

chat = ChatAnthropic()
chat.app()
```

This is a great way to quickly test your model, but you'll likely want to embed similar functionality into a larger web app. Here's how you can do that we different web frameworks.

## Shiny

Pass the result of `.chat()` directly to Shiny's [`ui.Chat` component](https://shiny.posit.co/py/components/display-messages/chat/) to create a chat interface in your own [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/py) app.

```python
from chatlas import ChatAnthropic
from shiny import ui

chat = ui.Chat(
  id="chat", 
  messages=["Hi! How can I help you today?"],
)

chat_model = ChatAnthropic()

@chat.on_user_submit
def _():
    response = chat_model.chat(chat.user_input())
    chat.append_message_stream(response)
```
